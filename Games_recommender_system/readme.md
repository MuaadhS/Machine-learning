# Games Recommender System

This is a machine learning project that aims to develop a games recommender system based on the IGN dataset. The system takes in the names of a user's favorite games and suggests new games that the user might enjoy based on similarities in game features and user scores.
<br />**Note:** This project is a direct implementation of the algorithms. For better results the data needs to be preprocessed and analyzed. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install.

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/MuaadhS/Machine-learning.git
```

Then, navigate to the `Games_recommender_system` directory and open the `Games_recommender.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the IGN video games dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games.

This dataset contains information about video games released between 1996 and 2016, including game titles, release dates, genres, platforms, developer and publisher names, and user and critic scores.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- difflib

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project

Once you have all the required packages installed, you can run the `Games_recommender.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to load and preprocess the dataset, train the machine learning model, and use the recommender system.
